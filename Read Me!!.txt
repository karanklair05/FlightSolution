Solution - Coding Assessment

The java console application consists of TransportFlight.java containing the main() method, the entry point of the program. The main() method prompts the user to select an option from 3 different options implemented with help of switch case inside a do-while loop. The first 2 options are solutions for User Story 1 and User story 2 respectively. The third option is to exit the application.

1.) Display Flight Schedule: 
- The FlightDetails.java class contains the getters/setters and necessary methods required to store and display the flight details.
- The FlightDetailsImpl.java stores the information in form of ArrayList<> and returns the results in the form of ArrayList<> of type FlightDetails.
- The FlightDetailsImpl.java is the implementation of the fetchflightDetails() method having return type List<FlightDetails> located in FlightDetailsService.java

2.)Load Order details :
- Similarly, OrderDetails.java class contains the getters/setters and necessary methods required to store and display the order details.
- The FlightDetailsImpl.java also contains the implementation of List<OrderDetails> displayOrderDetails(String location) method declared in FlightDetailsService.java
- I have read the Json file using JSONObject class and stored in form of  List<OrderDetails>, then there is some validation using Loops, Logical Operators and some String Manipulation operation.

3.) Exit.....
